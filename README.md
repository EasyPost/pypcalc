*PyPCalc* is a command-line program similar to the venerable [ipcalc](http://jodies.de/ipcalc) for analyzing IP
addresses and netmasks.

This software works out-of-the-box with Python 3.3+, or on Python 2.7+ with the
[ipaddress](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipaddress) backport module. Installation with `setup.py` will Do The
Right Thing based on the interpreter version you install with.
